Here's why using <= in the removeFromHeap function is important for correctness:

Reason:

The sliding window median logic relies on maintaining a clear separation between the two heaps:

maxHeap: Should contain the smaller half of the elements in the window.
minHeap: Should contain the larger half of the elements in the window.
Consider this scenario:

Let's say the current median is calculated from the top elements of maxHeap and minHeap.
Now, the number to be removed from the window has the same value as the current median (i.e., the maximum element of maxHeap).
Here's why simply using == could lead to errors:

If you check only for equality (num == (\*maxHeap)[0]) and remove the number from the maxHeap, the heaps may become unbalanced or empty. This would break the logic for calculating the median, especially if the element you're removing is crucial for calculating the current median.
Why <= Works

By using <=, you ensure that if the number to be removed has the same value as the largest element in the maxHeap:

It gets removed correctly: This maintains the invariant that the maxHeap only stores the smaller half of numbers.
Balance is preserved: During rebalancing, if the median value was crucial, it would potentially get moved from the maxHeap to the minHeap, preserving the correct window.
In essence, <= helps in making the code resilient to cases where the number to be removed is also the dividing point between the maxHeap and minHeap.
