The line `if N%i == 0 || N%(i+2) == 0 {` is used in a function to check if a number `N` is prime. It efficiently reduces the number of checks needed by leveraging the pattern that prime numbers (beyond 2 and 3) must be of the form `6k Â± 1`, where `k` is an integer. Here's how it works:

- `N % i == 0`: This part checks if `N` is divisible by `i`. If `N` can be divided evenly by `i` (meaning the remainder is 0), then `N` is not a prime number, because prime numbers have only two distinct divisors: 1 and themselves.

- `N % (i + 2) == 0`: This checks if `N` is divisible by `i + 2`. If `N` can be divided evenly by `i + 2`, then `N` is not prime for the same reason as above.

The reason for specifically checking `i` and `i + 2`, often starting with `i = 5`, is based on the observation that after 2 and 3, all prime numbers must be in the form of `6k - 1` or `6k + 1`:

- Numbers of the form `6k`, `6k + 2`, and `6k + 4` are divisible by 2, and hence not prime.
- Numbers of the form `6k + 3` are divisible by 3, and hence not prime.
- This leaves only numbers of the form `6k + 1` and `6k - 1` (which is also `6k + 5` for the previous `k`), which could potentially be prime.

By starting at `i = 5` (`6k - 1` for `k = 1`) and checking both `i` and `i + 2` in each iteration, the function covers all potential primes efficiently, skipping even numbers and multiples of 3 that cannot be prime.

Mine:
6k - 1 = 5 = N % i
6k + 1 = 7 = N % i+2
