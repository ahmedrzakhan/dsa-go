basically if its not exact we cannot use hashmap

ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. When the sum is not required to be exact but rather at least a certain value (K), the hashmap approach might not be the best solution due to its effectiveness in tracking exact sums and their occurrences. For problems requiring a sum greater than or equal to a certain value, a sliding window or two-pointer technique is often more suitable and efficient.
