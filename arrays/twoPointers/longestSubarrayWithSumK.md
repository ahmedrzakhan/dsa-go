Here's how the sliding window approach would proceed and where it might fail:

Start: The window begins with the first element [1], and the sum is 1.
Expansion: The window expands to include 2, making the sum 3.
Further Expansion: The window continues to expand, adding -5, which reduces the sum to -2.
Continued Expansion: Adding the next 1 brings the sum to -1, and then adding 2 brings the sum to 1.
Shrinking the Window: Since the sum is now greater than the target (0), the sliding window approach would start shrinking the window from the left to reduce the sum. However, removing 1, 2, and -5 sequentially brings the sum to -1 again after removing -5.
Failed to Find: The correct sub-array [1, 2, -5, 1, 2] has the sum 1, and when the last element -1 is added, the sum becomes 0, which meets the target. However, the sliding window approach might have already moved past the -5 and failed to consider this sub-array as a potential candidate when the sum went negative upon adding -5.
In this example, the sliding window approach might prematurely discard portions of the array that contribute to a valid solution because the sum fluctuates below the target due to the negative number -5. The approach assumes that expanding the window can only increase the sum and shrinking it (by moving the left pointer right) can only decrease the sum, which doesn't hold true when negative numbers are present. This leads to missing the correct sub-array [1, 2, -5, 1, 2, -1] that sums up to the target 0.


    Understanding Cumulative Sum:
A cumulative sum at any index i in an array is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to the ith element.
If cumSum[i] represents the cumulative sum at index i, then cumSum[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i].
Identifying Subarray Sums:
Consider two indices, i and j, where i < j. The sum of the subarray from i+1 to j can be calculated as cumSum[j] - cumSum[i].
This is because cumSum[j] includes the sum of elements from 0 to j, and subtracting cumSum[i] removes the sum of elements from 0 to i, leaving us with the sum from i+1 to j.
Using Sum - K to Find Subarrays:
When you're looking for a subarray with a sum equal to K, you're essentially trying to find indices i and j such that cumSum[j] - cumSum[i] = K.
Rearranging this equation gives you cumSum[j] - K = cumSum[i]. This means that, at any index j, if you've previously encountered a cumulative sum equal to cumSum[j] - K, there exists a subarray ending at j with the sum K.

    cumSum[j] - cumSum[i] = K
    cumSum[j] = cumSum[i] - K
