Code's Purpose:

This code snippet is part of the deletion operation in a Binary Search Tree (BST), specifically, the case when the node to be deleted has two children. Here's the breakdown:

successor := findMin(curr.R):

curr refers to the node you want to delete.
curr.R is the right subtree of the node you're deleting.
findMin is a helper function that finds the node with the smallest key in a given subtree.
This line finds the inorder successor of the node to be deleted. The inorder successor is the smallest node within the right subtreeâ€”guaranteed to be larger than the current node but smaller than all other nodes in the right subtree.
curr.Key = successor.Key

This line replaces the key of the node you're deleting (curr) with the key of its inorder successor. The goal is to preserve the BST property (all nodes in the left subtree are smaller, all in the right are larger).
curr.R = deleteNode(curr.R, successor.Key)

This line recursively calls the deleteNode function to delete the inorder successor from the right subtree. Since the inorder successor is guaranteed to have at most one child, this deletion will be simpler.
Example:

Let's say you have the following BST, and you want to delete node 15:
```
          15
         /  \
        8    20
      /  \     \
     5   10    25
```
Find Inorder Successor: findMin(curr.R) would be called with curr.R being the node 20. The inorder successor is 25.
Replace Key: The key 15 is replaced with 25. The tree now looks like this:
```
       25
      /  \
     8    20
   /  \    
  5   10   
```
Delete Successor: deleteNode(curr.R, successor.Key) is called to delete the node with key 25. Since 25 is a leaf node, it's easily removed.
The Result:
The node 15 has been effectively deleted while maintaining the BST properties!

Key Points:

This strategy ensures the BST structure remains valid after deletion.
The inorder successor is the best choice for replacement because it maintains the order of the tree.
