Certainly! Let's visualize the linked list structure and the process of merging using the dummy node, especially focusing on the scenarios where one or both lists are empty. In a singly-linked list, each node typically has two components:

Data (Val): The value or data stored in the node.
Next: A pointer (or reference) to the next node in the list.
Visualization Setup
Each node is represented as a box with two parts: [Data | Next].
The Next part points to the next node in the list.
nil represents the end of a list or an empty list.
Example 1: One List is Empty
Let's say l1 is empty (nil) and l2 is 2 -> 4 -> 6.

Initial Lists
l1: nil
l2: [2 | Next] -> [4 | Next] -> [6 | nil]
Merging Process
Create Dummy Node: dummy: [ | Next], current: Points to dummy.

Merge: Since l1 is nil, skip loop. current.Next is set to l2.

Final State:

dummy: [ | Next] -> [2 | Next] -> [4 | Next] -> [6 | nil]
The merged list starts from dummy.Next.
Merged List
dummy.Next: [2 | Next] -> [4 | Next] -> [6 | nil]
Example 2: Both Lists are Empty
Here, both l1 and l2 are empty (nil).

Initial Lists
l1: nil
l2: nil
Merging Process
Create Dummy Node: dummy: [ | Next], current: Points to dummy.

Merge: Both l1 and l2 are nil, skip loop. current.Next remains nil.

Final State:

dummy: [ | nil]
The merged list is empty, starting from dummy.Next.
Merged List
dummy.Next: nil (represents an empty list)
Conclusion
In both cases, the dummy node simplifies the merging process. When one list is empty, the non-empty list is directly linked to dummy.Next. When both lists are empty, dummy.Next remains nil, correctly representing an empty merged list. The use of a dummy node ensures that the merging logic is consistent and straightforward, regardless of whether the input lists are empty or not.
