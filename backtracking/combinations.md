The time complexity O(k \* C(n, k)) for generating combinations represents two factors:

C(n, k): This is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. It's also known as "n choose k" and is calculated as n! / [k! * (n-k)!].

k: This factor comes into play because, for each combination generated, an operation proportional to k (the size of the combination) is performed - typically copying the combination into the final output.
