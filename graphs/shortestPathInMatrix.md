The space complexity of O(min(M, N)) for the "Shortest Path in Binary Matrix" problem arises from the behavior of the BFS algorithm. In a grid, BFS spreads out in all directions. The maximum breadth of this spread, at any point in time, is limited by the smaller of the grid's dimensions (either its width or height). This is because the largest possible layer of nodes to explore next (the wavefront) can't exceed the grid's smallest dimension. Hence, the queue in BFS, at its maximum, would hold elements proportional to the smaller dimension of the grid, leading to the space complexity of O(min(M, N)).
