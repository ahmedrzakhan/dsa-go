In the BFS implementation, the length of the queue at the start of the for loop determines the number of iterations for that loop. This queue length corresponds to the number of cells in the current level of BFS. Even if new cells are added to the queue during the loop's execution, they are not processed until the next level. This ensures that length is incremented only after processing all cells of the current level, correctly reflecting the number of steps in the BFS traversal.
