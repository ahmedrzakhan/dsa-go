"If you are at a particular index and your current sum is this, there are this many ways to reach the target amount from this point onwards."

Let's break this down:

State: The cache doesn't just store whether you can reach the target from a certain state but how many different combinations will get you to the target.
Not the Path, the Count: The cache doesn't track the specific coin combinations themselves. It stores the count of how many different valid combinations exist.
Example:

Let's say cache[[2, 4]] = 3. This means:

You're considering coins from index 2 onwards in your coin array.
Your current accumulated sum is 4.
There are 3 different ways to reach the target amount using coins from index 2 onwards, given your current sum of 4.
Why it Matters:

Storing the count of combinations is what enables the dynamic programming solution to work efficiently:

We build our solution bottom-up by starting with smaller accumulated sums.
The cache allows us to reuse these 'subproblem' solutions when dealing with larger accumulated sums and different indices.
